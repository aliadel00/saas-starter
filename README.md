## 🚀 SaaS Starter — Production-Ready Fullstack Foundation

A production-ready fullstack SaaS boilerplate built to simulate real-world enterprise architecture and scalability patterns.

This project demonstrates clean modular design, authentication and authorization strategies, multi-tenant architecture, and scalable backend patterns using modern technologies.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* Next.js (App Router)
* NestJS (Modular Monolith Architecture)
* GraphQL (Code-first approach)
* PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
* Redis (caching & queues)
* Dockerized environment

### 🔐 Core Capabilities

* JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Multi-tenant data isolation
* Background job processing
* Centralized error handling
* Generic pagination system
* Soft-delete pattern
* Environment-based configuration
* Clean folder structure following domain-driven principles

### 🏗 Architectural Focus

The project is structured as a modular monolith with clear separation of concerns, designed to evolve into a microservices architecture when needed.

It reflects production-grade practices including:

* Guard-based authorization
* Global validation pipeline
* Scalable database modeling
* Reusable base repository pattern
* Clean commit strategy and feature branching

### 🎯 Purpose

Built as a showcase of full-stack engineering capability, focusing not only on UI implementation but also on backend architecture, system design, and scalability considerations.
